I started noodling around on this after playing [The Estate of Baron Archambaud, an Ingrate](https://galazor.itch.io/the-estate-of-baron-archambaud-an-ingrate) by Kate Roesch & Steve Walsh.

The board set-up is based on the [Carta SRD](https://peachgardengames.itch.io/carta-srd):

There's also some nods toward maybe eventually implementing a tarot deck.
